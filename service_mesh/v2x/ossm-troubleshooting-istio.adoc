== Troubleshooting the control plane

The Istio control plane is composed of *Istiod* which consolidates several previous control plane components (Citadel, Galley, Pilot) into a single binary.   Deploying the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` also creates the other components that make up {ProductName} as described in the xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/ossm-architecture.adoc[architecture] topic.

== Troubleshooting the data plane

The *data plane* is a set of intelligent proxies that intercept and control all inbound and outbound network communication between microservices in the service mesh.

{ProductName} relies on a proxy sidecar within the applicationâ€™s pod to provide Service Mesh capabilities to the application.
