= Single tenancy model

[role="_abstract"]
In Istio, a tenant is a group of users that share common access and privileges for a set of deployed workloads. Tenants can be used to provide a level of isolation between different teams.

Single tenant, cluster-wide control plane configurations are deprecated as of {ProductName} version 1.0.  {ProductName} defaults to a multitenant model.
