= Troubleshooting Envoy proxy

The Envoy proxy intercepts all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh. Envoy also collects and reports telemetry on the service mesh. Envoy is deployed as a sidecar to the relevant service in the same pod.

== Enabling access logs

Envoy access logs are useful in diagnosing traffic failures and flows and help with end-to-end traffic flow analysis.

To enable access logging for all istio-proxy containers, edit the ServiceMeshControlPlane (SMCP) file.
