= Single mesh deployment model

[role="_abstract"]
The simplest Istio deployment model is a single mesh.

Within a mesh, service names are unique. For example, only one service can have the name `myservice` in the `mynamespace` namespace. Additionally, workload instances share a common identity since service account names are unique within a namespace, just like service names.
