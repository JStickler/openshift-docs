= Troubleshooting the service mesh control plane

The steps for deploying the service mesh control plane (SMCP) include verifying the deployment in the OpenShift console. You can also execute the following command to see if the control plane pods are available and running, where `istio-system` is the namespace where you installed the SMCP.
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -n istio-system
----
You should see something similar to the following:
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

You can check the status of the control plane deployment with the following command, where `istio-system` is the namespace where you deployed the SMCP.
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get smcp -n istio-system
----
You should see something similar to the following:
[source,terminal]
----
NAME    READY   STATUS            PROFILES      VERSION   AGE
basic   9/9     ComponentsReady   ["default"]   2.0.1.1   19m
----
The installation has finished successfully when the STATUS column is `ComponentsReady`.

If you have modified and redeployed your control plane, the status should read `UpdateSuccdessful`:
[source,terminal]

NAME            READY     STATUS             TEMPLATE   VERSION   AGE
