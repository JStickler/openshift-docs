This topic describes common issues experienced with regards to sidecar initialization.

== istio-init container fails to start
The istio-init container fails to start when Istio is trying to create the sidecar.  The istio-init container logs show the following message:

`iptables v1.6.0: can't initialize iptables table `nat': Table does not exist (do you need to insmod?) Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.``

With the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, the firewall has been migrated from iptables to nftables. The current default {ProductName} images are designed on top of RHEL 8 and are no longer compatible with iptables based systems. If the host operating system is based on iptables rather than nftables, the proxy-init image must be set to the CentOS 7 version instead.

To fix this issue, add the following change to your `ServiceMeshControlPlane` and redeploy your pod.

[source,yaml]

  istio:
    global:
      proxy_init:
        image: proxy-init-centos7
